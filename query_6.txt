---(6) Return the team that has scored more goals in the extratime of UEFA Euro matches not ended on penalties

AGGREGATION on 'results' collection

STAGE 1: $facet of 2 pipelines:
	UEFA_Euro_matches_ended_on_penalties: [$match to get all the FIFA World Cup matches, $lookup from 'shootouts', $unwind shootouts, $project to exclude the 'shootouts' information and keep only the 'results' attributes]
	UEFA_Euro_matches: [$match to get all the FIFA World Cup matches]
STAGE 2: $project to output a new array UEFA_Euro_matches_not_ended_on_penalties, obtained making the $setDifference between UEFA_Euro_matches and UEFA_Euro_matches_ended_on_penalties
STAGE 3: $unwind UEFA_Euro_matches_not_ended_on_penalties to get a document for each match
STAGE 4: $lookup on 'goalscorers' to get all the goals scored in each match
STAGE 5: $unwind goalscorers to get a document for each goal
STAGE 6: $match if the goal has been scored at a minute greater than 90
STAGE 7: $group by the team that scored the goal, with a $count on the number of such goals scored by each team
STAGE 8: $sort by the number of goals in descendent order
STAGE 9: $limit to the team that has scored more goals in the extratime of FIFA World Cup matches that did not end on penalties
