---(5) All the matches won on penalties by teams that have ever conceded a goal by Ronaldo

AGGREGATION on 'goalscorers' collection

STAGE 1: $match to get only the goals by Ronaldo and to exclude possible own goals
STAGE 2: $lookup from the 'results' collection, to get the highlights of the matches for each goal
STAGE 3: $match to know that the home_team was not Brazil
STAGE 4: $unwind the results array
STAGE 5: $group by the home_team to get the set of teams that have conceded a goal by Ronaldo while playing at home
STAGE 6: $unionWith a pipeline that returns the set of teams that have conceded a goal by Ronaldo while playing away
STAGE 7: $group on _id to avoid possible duplicates
STAGE 8: $lookup from 'shootouts' collection with local field _id and foreign field winner, in order to get all the matches won on penalties by each team that has ever conceded a goal by Ronaldo.
	In fact, in each document we have the name of the team and an array containing the match_id of each match won on penalties by the team.
STAGE 9: $unwind of matches_won_on_penalties, to get a document for each match
STAGE 10: $lookup from 'results' collection to get the highlight of the matches
STAGE 11: $unwind of results array
STAGE 12: $project to make the output more readable
