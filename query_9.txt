---(9) For every team, return the name and the average number of goal scored in matches that ended on penalties

AGGREGATION on 'results' collection

STAGE 1: $lookup from 'shootouts'
STAGE 2: $unwind shootouts to get all the matches ended on penalties
STAGE 3: $facet of two pipelines:
	home_matches: [$group by home_team with a $count of the home matches for each team and a $sum of the home_score]
	away_matches: [$group by away_team with a $count of the away matches for each team and a $sum of the away_score]
STAGE 4: $unwind home_matches
STAGE 5: $unwind away_matches
STAGE 6: $match to get the documents in which home_matches._id is equal to away_matches._id
STAGE 7: $project to output the name of the team, the number of matches ended on penalties ($add home and away matches), the number of goals scored in such matches ($add home and away goals), and the average number of goals ($divide the two $add)
