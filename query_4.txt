---(4) Teams that have played FIFA World Cup matches, winning none of them

AGGREGATION on 'results' collection

The only way to know if a team has played a match is to check if it was the home or the away team
The only way to know if a team has won a match is to check if the home_score was greater than the away_score while such team was the home_team, or vice versa.
We also have to take in account the possibility for a team to win a match on penalties.
Therefore we used a facet of 4 pipelines

STAGE 1: $match to get all the FIFA World Cup matches
STAGE 2: $facet of 5 pipelines:
	teams_that_played_home: [$group on home_team]
	teams_that_played_away: [$group on away_team]
	teams_that_won_home: [$match if home_score is greater than away_score, then $group on home_team]
	teams_that_won_away: [$match if home_score is less than away_score, then $group on away_team]
	teams_that_won_on_penalties: [$lookup from 'shootouts', $group on shootouts.winner, $unwind _id]

STAGE 3: $project to output two arrays instead of 5:
	teams_that_played_a_match: $setUnion of teams that played home and away
	teams_that_won_a_match: $setUnion of teams that won home, away, and teams that won on penalties

STAGE 4: $project to output the final array:
	teams_that_have_never_won: $setDifference between teams_that_played_a_match and teams_that_won_a_match
	We could have already made the difference between the two $setUnion in STAGE 3, but we wanted to make the code more readable

STAGE 5: $unwind of teams_that_have_never_won
STAGE 6: $project teams_that_have_never_won._id to make the output more readable
