---(7) For every team return the name, the percentage of won matches, the number of played matches and the number of won matches --- no penalties

AGGREGATION on 'results' collection

STAGE 1: $facet of 4 pipelines:
	played_home_matches: [$group by home_team with $count of all the matches played at home by such team]
	played_away_matches: [$group by away_team with $count of all the matches played away by such team]
	won_home_matches: [$match if home_score is greater than away_score, then $group by home_team with $count of all the matches won at home by such team]
	won_away_matches: [$match if home_score is less than away_score, then $group by away_team with $count of all the matches won away by such team]
STAGE 2: $unwind of played_home_matches
STAGE 3: $unwind of played_away_matches
STAGE 4: $unwind of won_home_matches
STAGE 5: $unwind of won_away_matches
STAGE 6: $match to have all the documents with played_home_matches and played_away_matches referring to the same team
STAGE 7: $match to have all the documents with played_away_matches and won_home_matches referring to the same team
STAGE 8: $match to have all the documents with won_home_matches and won_away_matches referring to the same team. 	Now we have a document for each team, containing the number of matches played at home and away and the number of matches won at home and away
STAGE 9: $project to output for each team its name, the number of matches that it played ($add played_home_matches and $played away matches), the number of matches that it won ($add won_home_matches and won_away_matches), and the percentage of won matches ($divide the two $add)
STAGE 10: $sort by number of won matches in descendent order
