---(8) Matches lost because of an own goal

AGGREGATION on 'goalscorers' collection

We assume that a game is lost because of an own goal if the team that committed the own goal lost the game by a margin of only one goal

STAGE 1: $match to get only the own goals
STAGE 2: $lookup from 'results' to get the match referring to each goal
STAGE 3: $unwind results
STAGE 4: $match with an $and inside, to get all the matches that has been lost by the home team by a margin of only one goal, in which the team that scored the own goal was the away team (so the home team committed the own goal)
STAGE 5: $project to build the output with the highlights of the match, the name of the own goal scorer and the minute in which the own goal occurred
STAGE 6: $unionWith a pipeline that has the same structure as this one, but in which the away team has lost the game because of an own goal
